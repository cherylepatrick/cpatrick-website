The recording is of our performance at the [UCL high-energy physics](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk) department Christmas Event. We also performed a shortened version at the [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk) festival in 2018, which brings science to the people - in the pub. The Double Betas are [Anastasia Basharina-Freshville](https://twitter.com/AnastasiaBasha) and Lauren Dawson.
