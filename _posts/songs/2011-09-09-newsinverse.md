This poem was selected in [Symmetry Magazine](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org)'s 2017 Valentine contest to write a particle physics love poem. I chose two write about quarks, which group up in threes to form baryons, such as protons and neutrons. What's more Valentine-appropriate than a physics threesome? You can see this poem, and some of the magazine's other favourites on [Symmetry's website](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/physics-love-poems). Here's a [nice article](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/PT.3.2655) from Physics Today about the physics of quark colour.



<p><em>Some people wish for one true love,<br/>
like dear old Ma and Pa.<br/>
That lifestyle’s not for us; we like<br/>
our quark ménage à trois.</em></p>

<p><em>You see, some like a threesome,<br/>
and I love both of you.<br/>
No green quark would be seen without<br/>
a red quark and a blue.</em></p>

<p><em>
The sea is full of other quarks,<br/>
but darlings, I don’t heed ‘em.<br/>
You must believe I don’t exploit<br/>
my asymptotic freedom.</em></p>

<p><em>
And when you pull away from me,<br/>
I just can’t take the stress.<br/>
My attraction just grows stronger<br/>
(coefficient alpha-s).</em></p>

<p><em>
With you, my life is colourless;<br/>
you bring stability.<br/>
Without you, I’m unstable,<br/>
so I need you, Q.C.D.</em></p>

<p><em>
I love our quirky, quarky love.<br/>
My Valentines, let’s carry on<br/>
exchanging gluons wantonly,<br/>
and make a little baryon.
</em></p>
