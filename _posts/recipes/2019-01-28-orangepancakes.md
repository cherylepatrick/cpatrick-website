 1. The night before you want to make the pancakes, soak the currants in the orange liqueur, reserving 1 tablespoon. If you don’t have time, soak them for at least half an hour.
 2. Whisk the egg until it is light and fluffy.
 3. Pour the liqueur from the currants into a measuring jug. Make it up to 3/4 cup with milk.
 4. Add this milk/liqueur mix, the flour, sugar, baking powder, polenta  and salt to the egg and mix together. The batter should be a little lumpy.
 5. Zest the oranges and add the zest to the pancake batter, along with the currants. Mix until combined.
 6. Now make the sauce. Juice the oranges and add the agave nectar. Heat in a small pan or the microwave until almost boiling.
 7. Mix the remaining tablespoon of liqueur with the corn flour. When the juice is hot, mix in the cornflour mixture and either microwave a further 30 seconds or heat, stirring, in the pan until it thickens. Give it a stir and leave it in a warm place while you cook the pancakes.
 8. Fry spoonfuls of the pancake mix in a mixture of butter and sunflower oil, on a medium-low heat. Flip when the bottom seems solid and you see bubbles in the top. The baking powder and acid should make them puff up.
 9. When the pancakes are cooked, serve with the orange sauce.

American-style pancakes are a wonderful weekend treat, but when the wind's howling and the rain batters the windowpanes, you need a cosy, wintery version that makes you feel snug, nourished, and glad to be inside. Warming orange and sweet, punchy little currants bring to mind a hot mug of mulled wine or gløgg - perfect for a grey, British January. I serve them with a sweet and sour orange sauce.
