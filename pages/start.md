<p> Hello! I'm an <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/career-and-skills-development/fellowships/ernest-rutherford-fellowships/" _target="blank"> STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellow</a> in high-energy particle physics at the  <a href="https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/particle-physics-experiment" _target="blank"> University of Edinburgh</a>. My research is focussed on tiny, mysterious particles called neutrinos, and what we can discover about both neutrinos and nuclei when they interact in various ways.

<p>I'm a member of three great physics collaborations. The <a href="http://supernemo.org" _target="blank">SuperNEMO</a> experiment, where I'm analysis coordinator, will look for neutrinoless double-beta decay - a never-seen radioactive decay that could be the only process to create matter without antimatter. It can also give us unique insights into nuclear processes. 
</p>
<p>I'm also a convener of the neutrino-interaction and Standard Model physics group on <a href="https://www.dunescience.org"> DUNE</a>, a huge next-generation experiment that will study the beyond-the-Standard-Model process opf neutrino oscillations. Understanding how neutrinos interact with matter is key to DUNE's success, and on the <a href="https://www.e4nu.com">e4nu</a> experiment, we approach this in a novel way, by looking for parallels with electron scattering.

<p>For many years, I've enjoyed writing comic poetry, so it seemed natural to combine my two interests and branch out into science-themed poetry and songs. I've had a great time performing my songs, and would love the opportunity to do more. Give me a call if you're interested in something, because I'm always looking for inspiration!</p>

<p>When I'm not doing physics or writing poems, I enjoy travelling, getting out in the Scottish countryside, cooking, and playing with my two adorable but naughty cats. I once folded 1000 origami cranes in physics seminars.</p>
<p>I am including cat pictures, because I know that's why you're really here.</p>
