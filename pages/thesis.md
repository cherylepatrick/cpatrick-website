As a PhD student, I worked on the [MINERvA][1] experiment at [Fermilab][2], supervised by [Prof. Heidi Schellman][3] at [Northwestern University][4]  (now at [Oregon State][5]). I defended my thesis, [_Measurement of the Antineutrino Double-Differential Charged-Current Quasi-Elastic Scattering Cross Section at MINERvA_] [6] on March 9th, 2016, and officially graduated in June 2016, the day before presenting my results at the [Fermilab Wine and Cheese Seminar][7]. In 2017, I was delighted to receive the [Springer Thesis Prize][8] and my thesis was published in [book form][9]. In 2018, we published the analysis as [ _C.E. Patrick et al (MINERvA collaboration), Phys. Rev. D 97, 052002_][10].
