<p>A former professional software developer from Europe, I moved to the USA to work on a PhD in high-energy particle physics. After six years in Chicago working on <a href="http://fnal.gov" _target="blank">Fermilab's</a> <a href="https://minerva.fnal.gov" _target="blank">MINERvA</a> neutrino-scattering experiment, I'm now at <a href="https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk" _target="blank">UCL</a> in London, where I am currently Analysis Coordinator of the <a href="http://supernemo.org" _target="blank">SuperNEMO</a> neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment.

<p>For many years, I've enjoyed writing comic poetry, so it seemed natural to combine my two interests and branch out into science-themed poetry and songs. I've had a great time performing my songs, and would love the opportunity to do more. Give me a call if you're interested in something, because I'm always looking for inspiration!</p>

<p>When I'm not doing physics or writing poems, I enjoy travelling, getting out in the Kent countryside, cooking, and playing with my two adorable but naughty cats. I once folded 1000 origami cranes in physics seminars.</p>
<p>I am including cat pictures, because I know that's why you're really here.</p>
