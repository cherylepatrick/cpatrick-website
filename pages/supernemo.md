teaser: "We live in a universe that's made of matter, rather than antimatter - but why? SuperNEMO is a new experiment looking for a radioactive decay so rare that it's never been seen. It could give us the clue we need to understand the matter-antimatter imbalance - but does it exist at all?"

Since 2016, I've been working at [UCL][2], on the [SuperNEMO][1] experiment, a new detector that we are building under a mountain the [LSM][3] underground lab, in the French Alps. SuperNEMO is looking for a process called neutrinoless double-beta decay. Double-beta decay is a rare radioactive decay that has been observed in 13 isotopes - where two neutrons in an atomic nucleus decay to protons, producing two electrons and two antineutrinos - tiny, invisible particles of antimatter. Like all known processes in the universe, this creates both matter (electrons) and antimatter (the antineutrinos).

However, there is a theory, popular in the scientific community, that suggests that neutrinos, which are uncharged, might be _Majorana_ particles - in other words, that they might be their own antiparticles. In this case, it should be possible that the double-beta decay could take place producing just the two electrons, with no (anti)neutrinos in the final state. If this process - _neutrinoless double-beta decay_  - was observed, not only would it tell us important information about the nature of the neutrino, but it would be the first observation of a process that creates matter without creating antimatter. This would be huge news - especially since we know that we live in a universe made only of matter, and not of antimatter, but we don't know how that came about.

You can find lots more information about SuperNEMO, and how it looks for neutrinoless double-beta decay, in the [SuperNEMO website][1], which I designed and developed. My main role in the SuperNEMO project is as **analysis coordinator**, where I work with and advise the students and researchers working on analysis tasks for the experiment. I also sit on the steering and speakers' committees of the experiment. I take a particular role in helping to supervise some of the graduate students at UCL.


I have also taken many trips to the LSM, where I have been heavily involved in the installation of SuperNEMO's fine-grained tracker. This is key to SuperNEMO's unique ability to not only measure particle energies, but to track the trajectories and momenta of the individual particles in a decay event.
